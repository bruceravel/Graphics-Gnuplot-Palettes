* Graphics-Gnuplot-Palettes

A collection of high-quality palettes for surface plots made using Gnuplot.

This is useful for any Pel-to-Gnuplot interface, including
L<PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot>, L<Graphics::GnuplotIF>, and probably others.

** Color Map Advice for Scientific Visualization

This set of color maps is from Kenneth Moreland following the
principles in his paper, "Why We Use Bad Color Maps and What You Can
Do About It." Kenneth Moreland. In Proceedings of Human Vision and
Electronic Imaging (HVEI), 2016. (To appear.)  See also his web site

** CET Perceptually Uniform Colour Maps

This set of color maps is designed to have uniform perceptual contrast
over their whole range.  See http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/

All palettes in this group are the work of Peter Kovesi The University
of Western Australia.  They are used under the terms of the [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/][Creative
Commons BY License]].  For more information, see the website or Kovesi's
paper [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03700.pdf][Good Colour Maps: How to Design Them]], (arXiv:1509.03700
[cs.GR] 2015)

The palettes in this group were generated from [[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/CETperceptual_ParaView.xml][this XML file]] using a
script in this repository.

The language used in Kovesi's palettes was a little unwieldy for this
purpose, so I adopted a file name shortening scheme as follows:

| symbol | word        | explanation                                                                           |
|--------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C      | cyclic      | colors that are matched at each end with first order continuity                       |
| I      | isoluminant | constructed from colours of equal perceptual lightness                                |
| L      | linear      | color lightness values that increase or decrease linearly over the colour map's range |
| D      | divergent   | follow some pattern of symmetry about their center                                    |
| RB     | rainbow     | nominally follow some representation of the color spectrum                            |

And here are is the connection between perl module names and original
color map names.

The original file names are explained in an image 
from [[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/][Kovesi's web site]].  The following text is copied from 
there.  Examples are given for each color map at the web site.

[[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/NamingConvention.png]]

+ A colour map may have more than one attribute. For example,
  diverging-linear or cyclic-isoluminant.

+ Lightness values can range from 0 to 100. For linear colour maps the
  two lightness values indicate the first and last lightness values in
  the map. For diverging colour maps the second value indicates the
  lightness value of the centre point of the colour map (unless it is
  a diverging-linear colour map). For cyclic and rainbow colour maps
  the two values indicate the minimum and maximum lightness
  values. Isoluminant colour maps have only one lightness value.

+ The string of characters indicating the nominal hue sequence uses the following code

    | r - red    | g - green   | b - blue   |
    | c - cyan   | m - magenta | y - yellow |
    | o - orange | v - violet  |            |
    | k - black  | w - white   | j - grey   |

  ('j' rhymes with grey). Thus a 'heat' style colour map would be
  indicated by the string 'kryw'. If the colour map is predominantly
  one colour then the full name of that colour may be used. Note these
  codes are mainly used to indicate the hues of the colour map
  independent of the lightness/darkness and saturation of the colors.

+ Mean chroma/saturation is an indication of vividness of the color
  map. A value of 0 corresponds to a grey scale. A value of 50 or more
  will indicate a vivid colour map.
  
+ Depending on whether a cyclic colour map is being used to render
  data that is cyclic over 360 or 180 degrees a cyclic shift of 25%
  may be applied.

* Graphics-Gnuplot-Palettes

A collection of high-quality palettes for surface plots made using Gnuplot.

This is useful for any Perl-to-Gnuplot interface, including
[[https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot][PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot]], [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Graphics::GnuplotIF][Graphics::GnuplotIF]], and probably others.

** Installation

This installs like any perl package:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install
  #+END_EXAMPLE

The ~make test~ test step is fairly trivial.  When run in that way,
the test only checks to see that the module loads and that the
introspection functions work.  Proper testing that all the palettes
are defined correctly requires human interaction to see that each
palette in the collection works.  This is done by visual comparison
with the default palette.  To run the tests interactively do, for
instance, ~perl -Iblib/lib test.t~ in the main directory.

** Overview

To use this in a perl program:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
  use Graphics::Gnuplot::Palette;
  my $colors = palette("BlackBody");
  send_to_gnuplot_process("set palette $colors");
  #+END_SRC

A specific example for [[https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot][PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
  use Graphics::Gnuplot::Palette;
  my $w = PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot -> new();
  $w->image({palette=>palette("Kindlmann")}, $image_pdl);
  #+END_SRC

The ~palette~ method is exported by default and takes as its argument
one of the perl module names listed in the tables below.  In the case
of a name collision, you can specify the palette group also, like so:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
  my $colors = palette("Moreland", "BlackBody");
  #+END_SRC

In the two-argument form, the named palette will be searched for only
among that palette group.  In the one-argument form, the first one
found by that name is returned.

If the requested palette name cannot be found, the function returns
the string defining Gnuplot's traditional pm3d palette.  In that way,
/something/ sensible will always be plotted.

There are also introspection functions which return lists of groups
and palette names:

  #+BEGIN_SRC perl
  my @groups = palette_groups();
  my @all_names = palette_names();
  my @CET_names = palette_names("CET");
  #+END_SRC


** Palette groups

*** Gnuplot suggestions

 This set of color maps implements the suggested RGB values from the
 ~set palette~ section of the Gnuplot manual.

 The traditional pm3d palette is the return value for the palette
 method when it cannot figure out which palette you are asking for.
 The other are quite similar to offerings in the CET group.

*** Color Map Advice for Scientific Visualization

 This set of color maps is from Kenneth Moreland following the
 principles in his paper, "Why We Use Bad Color Maps and What You Can
 Do About It." Kenneth Moreland. In Proceedings of Human Vision and
 Electronic Imaging (HVEI), 2016. (To appear.)  See also his web site
 http://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice

 | perl module        | explanation                                                                                                                   |
 |--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | SmoothCoolWarm     | Diverging (double-ended) blue-white-red color map with a smooth transition in the middle to prevent artifacts at the midpoint |
 | BentCoolWarm       | Like above but interpolated linearly with a sharp bend in the middle                                                          |
 | BlackBody          | Based on colors from black-body radiation                                                                                     |
 | ExtendedBlackBody  | Like above but with blue and purple hues                                                                                      |
 | Kindlmann          | Rainbow color map with the luminance adjusted such that it monotonically changes                                              |
 | ExtendedKindlmann  | Like above but adds more hues by doing a more than 360 degree loop around the hues                                            |


*** CET Perceptually Uniform Colour Maps

 This set of color maps is designed to have uniform perceptual contrast
 over their whole range.  See http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/

 All palettes in this group are the work of Peter Kovesi of The
 University of Western Australia.  They are used under the terms of the
 [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/][Creative Commons BY License]].  For more information, see the website or
 Kovesi's paper [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03700.pdf][Good Colour Maps: How to Design Them]], (arXiv:1509.03700
 [cs.GR] 2015)

 The palettes in this group were generated from [[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/CETperceptual_ParaView.xml][this XML file]] using a
 script in this repository.

 The language used in Kovesi's palettes was a little unwieldy for this
 purpose, so I adopted a file name shortening scheme as follows:

 | symbol | word        | explanation                                                                           |
 |--------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | C      | cyclic      | colors that are matched at each end with first order continuity                       |
 | I      | isoluminant | constructed from colours of equal perceptual lightness                                |
 | L      | linear      | color lightness values that increase or decrease linearly over the colour map's range |
 | D      | divergent   | follow some pattern of symmetry about their center                                    |
 | RB     | rainbow     | nominally follow some representation of the color spectrum                            |

 And here are is the connection between perl module names and original
 color map names.  The astute will note that a couple of the originals
 are lost due to the file name shortening scheme.

 The original file names are explained in an image 
 from [[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/][Kovesi's web site]].  The following text is copied from 
 there.  Examples are given for each color map at the web site.

 [[http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/NamingConvention.png]]

 + A colour map may have more than one attribute. For example,
   diverging-isoluminant (D_I).

 + Lightness values can range from 0 to 100. For linear colour maps the
   two lightness values indicate the first and last lightness values in
   the map. For diverging colour maps the second value indicates the
   lightness value of the centre point of the colour map (unless it is
   a diverging-linear colour map). For cyclic and rainbow colour maps
   the two values indicate the minimum and maximum lightness
   values. Isoluminant colour maps have only one lightness value.

 + The string of characters indicating the nominal hue sequence uses
   the following code

     | r - red    | g - green   | b - blue   |
     | c - cyan   | m - magenta | y - yellow |
     | o - orange | v - violet  |            |
     | k - black  | w - white   | j - grey   |

   ('j' rhymes with grey). Thus a 'heat' style colour map would be
   indicated by the string 'kryw'. If the colour map is predominantly
   one colour then the full name of that colour may be used. Note these
   codes are mainly used to indicate the hues of the colour map
   independent of the lightness/darkness and saturation of the colors.

 + Mean chroma/saturation is an indication of vividness of the color
   map. A value of 0 corresponds to a grey scale. A value of 50 or more
   will indicate a vivid colour map.
  
 + Depending on whether a cyclic colour map is being used to render
   data that is cyclic over 360 or 180 degrees a cyclic shift of 25%
   may be applied.
